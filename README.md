# Project Title

BeerFlix

## Getting Started

```
# serve at localhost:3000
npm start
```

### Prerequisites

First of all install dependences

```
npm install
```

### Instructions

The web page seems intuitive, but just in case I will explain the functionality:

- Once page is loaded, it will load a list of ten beers
- The user can filter the list by using the search input
- Also, the user can filter by date (filtering the data already rendered)
- In every beer detail, the user can comment using the form
- Also the user can give a like by clicking the red hearth
- In each navigation, both title an image will change
- In case you choose another path not known by the app, it will return you a 404 page

### Lints and fixes files

```
npm run test
```

### Coding style tests

Everytime a commit is done, this will check:

- Two blank spaces in every new line
- A consistent linebreak style, adapted to windows
- Every string will have a single quote
